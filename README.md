Array Data Structure Diagram </p>

<p align="center"> Array is a collection of homogenous data stored together. The elements are of same datatype.  </p>
 

There are two different types of Arrays 

1. Static -> Allotment is done together of all the elements.  
2. Dynamic -> Allotment is done according to memory available.

* Features of Arrays

1. Index -> index value in most of the cases starts from 0.
2. Value -> value is the data stored in the array at any index
3. The difference between two indexes is called as "offset"
4. Some functions/methods used in array: -
 + sorting
 + inserting
 + display as string
 + copy, etc

Advantages of Arrays 

1. Used to implement other data structures like stacks, queue, heaps, hash tables, etc.
2. Used for CPU scheduling
3. Arrays stores data elements of the same datatype.
